void BeginDrawing()
In the context of the Raylib library, calling the BeginDrawing() function initializes the drawing frame and prepares the graphics system for rendering. 
This typically involves setting up the necessary buffers, states, and resources to draw graphics.

And each time the body of the while loop executes ...it is counted as a single frame

void EndDrawing()
The EndDrawing() function finalizes the frame by performing any necessary operations to ensure that the frame is displayed correctly on the screen. 
This may involve swapping buffers, synchronizing with the display refresh rate, and other internal operations specific to the graphics system being used.
